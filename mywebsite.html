  <h3>There are many things girls struggle through.
	Especially when your a teenager.
	One of the most important things that girls struggle with is being themselves around people.
	For example, when your in school, at the mall or maybe even at a party. There's always that little thing that you do outside of all of that, that nody knows.
	You may wish to keep it a secret...but why? What's so bad about this secret thing? What you do makes you, you! 
	It tells people what type of a person you are and it inspires you in many ways. I am a girl scout!
	I love being a girl scout because it's fun and teaches you a lot different things.I don't tell people that I'm a girl scout. Why you ask? I feel it's weird. 
	Maybe because I'm at a much older age and I don't want people like me to think that being a girl scout is kiddish? Well at least I use to feel that until I realized that
	I like being a girl scout. In addition, being a girl scout makes me, me. Girl scouts are a part of my life and even though I can change it, I choose not to. </h3>
